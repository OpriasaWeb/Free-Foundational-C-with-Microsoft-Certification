# switch-case

A switch statement is a C# selection statement that provides an alternative to an if-elseif-else branching construct. The switch statement provides advantages over an if-elseif-else construct when evaluating a single value against a list of known matching values.

Consider the following scenario:

- You're working on an application related to food nutrition. A section of the code deals with fruits.
- Your code includes a variable named fruit that's used to hold the name of different types of fruit.
- You have a list of the 20 fruits that your application is focused on.
- You want to branch your code based on the value assigned to fruit.
